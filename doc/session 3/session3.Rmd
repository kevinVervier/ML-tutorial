This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


# Session 3: Your turn !

Here, the idea is to apply the different classification techniques to a new data set, and compare them using the evaluation framework we described in Session 1 (parameter optimization, cross-validation, etc.)

Hints:
* Whatever the approach you use, your prediction step will often use the `predict` function.
