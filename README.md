Important: if you plan to run the Shiny application, you want to install the following R packages:
* shiny: interactive user interface running in R
* glmnet: generalized linear model with Elastic-Net implementation
* DT: render DataTable, better than Shiny default. Allows to color cells
* ggplot2: nice graphical tool
* RColorBrewer: nice color palette
* randomForest: package for learning ... random forest model


TODO:

* The 'Classification' part is under development.
* Consider different performance measures if binary or multiclass classification is considered
* Display selected features in Regularized Linear/Logistic Regression
* Show Feature importance in Random Forest
